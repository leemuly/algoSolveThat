// Contiguous subarrays are a group of an uninterrupted range of elements from an array as they occur. No elements in the range can be skipped or reordered. Given an array of integers, numbers and an integer k, determine the total number of subwarrays of numbers having a product that is less than or equal to k.

// For example, contiguous subarrays of numbers = [3,4,5] are [[3],[4],[5],[3,4],[4,5],[3,4,5]]. The product of a subarray is the product of all of its elements so the products for the list of subarrays are [3,4,5,12,20,60]. If k = 5, there are 3 subarrays that satisfy the condition, [3], [4] and [5].
