// given a string, ie "bloomberg", sort the characters in the order in which they appear in the initial string for repeating letters, then in alphabetical order for non-repeating letters, so 'bbooeglmr'
// 9:22
// but if it was 'obloomberg' it would have to be 'ooobbeglmr' because o appears before b in the string
